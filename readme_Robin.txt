----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code Files		Unaltered code files from the book "Adventures in Minecraft" by Martin O'Hanlon
MyAdventures	contains Robin's edits of Code Files, though not all have been modified.
MyEscapades		scripts for kids, meant as supplemental programs for "Adventures in Minecraft"
				recommended: coordinates_game.py  This game is a scripted sequence of events that is meant to be a fun introduction to coordinates for kids.  Make sure the server is set up so that the world spawn is at the origin (coordinates: 0, 0, 0), so that the block values displayed in the debug menu are in alignment with the world's absolute coordinates.  To set the spawn to the origin use the command /setworldspawn 0 0 0 
				This command can be used either in the server console (perhaps without the slash), or in the game chat.
mcpipy			These python scipts were obtained from https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod
				To learn more read the readme.md in the mcpipy folder or visit the site.  There are many great scripts in this folder.
